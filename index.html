      <h1>About</h1>
      <p id="about">Percy Jackson & the Olympians is based on a 12 year old kid who discovers that he is a demigod (half god-half human). He goes to a Camp for safety from monsters like the Minotaur who try to kill demigods. There, he makes new friends, dicovers his friend is a saytr (half goat- half human), and dicovers more. He also finds out that Zeus's master lightning bolt is stolen and he is the prime suspect. He has 2 options, either be killed by an army of monsters sent by the gods or find the lightning bolt and return it to Zeus before the summer solistice (the deadline). It would be hard work to go alone, so he is accompanied by his saytr friend (Grover) and Annabeth.He has to journey through many places in the US to find the bolt. He and his friends will also have to battle some dangerous monsters. He has to go to Las Vegas and go to the Underworld to retrieve his mom and see if Hades has the lightning bolt. When Percy finds out Hades doesn't have the lightning bolt, he escapes and goes away from  Hades before he kills him. He figures out he was the one carrying the lightning bolt in the backpack Ares gave. He has a fierce battle with Ares and he retrieves Hades' helm. Percy Jackson goes into an airplane back to New York to get to the Empire State Building. He goes to the 600th floor where Mount Olympus is and races to the big building ahead of him. Time is ticking so he reaches there speedily. He then gives the bolt to Zeus and returns home with a package from Olympus. He sees his mom is there and his mom takes the Medusa Head (the thing in the package) and shows it to Gabe who turns to stone. When Percy gets back to Camp half-blood he meets his friends who were waiting for him there. Annabeth was leaving because of the paper from Mr.D (Dionysus). Percy has two options, either to stay or to leave. He decides to go home for 7th grade and come back next year. Before leaving,</p>
