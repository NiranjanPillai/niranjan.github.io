      <h1>About</h1>
      <p id="about">Percy Jackson & the Olympians are about a 12-year-old kid who discovers that he is a demigod (half god-half human). He goes to a Camp for safety from monsters like the Minotaur, tries to kill demigods. At Camp, Percy makes new friends, discovers his friend is a saytr (half-goat- half-human), and finds more. He also finds out that Zeus's master lightning bolt got stolen. Percy is the prime suspect. He has two options, either be killed by an army of monsters sent by the gods or find the lightning bolt and return it to Zeus before the summer solstice (the deadline). It would be hard work to go alone, so Percy is accompanied by his saytr friend (Grover) and Annabeth. He has to journey through many places in the US to find the bolt. Percy and his friends will also have to battle some dangerous monsters. He has to go to Las Vegas and go to the Underworld to retrieve his mom and see if Hades has the lightning bolt. When Percy finds out Hades doesn't have the lightning bolt, Percy escapes and goes away from Hades before Hades kills him. He figures out he was the one carrying the lightning bolt in the backpack Ares gave. Ares has a fierce battle with him. He retrieves Hades' helm also, which he stole. Percy goes on an airplane back to New York to get to the Empire State Building. He goes to the 600th floor where Mount Olympus is and races to the big building ahead of him. Clock's ticking, Percy reaches there speedily. He then gives the bolt to Zeus and returns home with a box from Olympus. Percy sees his mom is there. His mom takes the Medusa Head (the thing in the box) and shows it to Gabe (his evil step-father), who turns to stone. When Percy gets back to Camp Half-Blood, he meets his friends who were waiting for him there. Annabeth was leaving because of the paper from Mr.D (Dionysus). It had two options, either to stay or to leave. He doesn't know which option to take yet. Before leaving, he meets Luke at the arena practicing his sword fighting, which Percy also planned to do. He and Luke decide to talk at the forest grounds at Camp Half-Blood. Luke tells him about the voice of Kronos he's been hearing and why Luke doesn't like the gods. He tells Percy that he was the actual Lightning Thief. He stole it for Kronos. Percy tells him not to listen to Kronos, but it's too late. A gigantic pit scorpion nearly kills him, which was summoned by Luke. He wakes up in the hospital bed. Chiron tells him to stay with Argus and Annabeth while he goes to Mount Olympus. Percy still has to choose whether to stay or to go. Annabeth said she had to leave. Percy decides to go back home to his mom and to start 7th grade. The story ends there. This book is by Rick Riordan, who is the New York Times #1 best-selling Percy Jackson book series. He currently lives in Boston and has three national awards. </p>
